## Existing Solutions
Problem: We don't want to give out our real email address to every other site
on the Internet.

### Disposable Email Addresses
*Examples:*
- Mailinator
- Fake Mail Generator
- Tempail

These services can quickly generate fake email addresses, and set up virtual
inboxes in which you can read email sent to those addresses. These are
generally intended for one-time usages, usually for sites which you plan to
use exactly once.

Why Not:
- Disposable emails addresses are not well-suited for situations in which a site
  might want to send emails and updates after the single-time usage.
- For many of these sites, the virtual inboxes are publicly accessible.
- Many email validation services now reject disposable email domains.

### Temporary Email Aliases
*Examples:*
- ShitMail

Temporary email aliases forward to your real email address. There is no public
virtual inbox. After a pre-set time duration, they stop forwarding email, and
all further communication to that email address is ignored.

Why Not:
- You need to know the duration of email usage ahead of time.
- There is no centralized email alias management dashboard. This makes it
  difficult or impossible to disable or change the lifetime of temporary
  email aliases.
- Many email validation services now reject the domains of temporary email
  alias services.

### Masked Emails
*Examples:*
- MaskMe (deprecated and folded into Blur)
    - [Masked Emails: an easy way to protect yourself online](https://www.abine.com/blog/2011/get-email-alias-to-avoid-the-next-data-breach/)
    - [Blur Masking](https://dnt.abine.com/#feature/masking)
    - [Mask Your Email Address While Using it on Shady Websites \| TechWiser](https://techwiser.com/mask-your-email-address/)
- IdBloc
- [Burner Mail](https://burnermail.io/)

Masked emails are similar to temporary email addresses, as they forward messages
along to your real email address. There is a centralized dashboard for managing
all the masked emails, and the ability to shut off masks as desired.

Masked emails work great in scenarios when you do want a service's emails
securely and privately delivered to your inbox in the general case, but still
want granular control over the emails you receive.

Why Not:
- These services usually do not allow setting a lifetime or expiry on given masked
  email addresses.
- Many email validation services can detect and reject the domains used by masked
  email service providers. For example, MaskMe only uses one domain, `opayq.com`,
  which is blocked by most email validation services. 

#### Email Validation Services
*Examples:*
- [Verifalia email validator](https://verifalia.com/validate-email)
- [Powerful Real-Time Email Verification API \| Email Checker](https://www.emailchecker.com/real-time-api/)
- [Email Validation Service - Verification with Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/email-validation)
- [disposable-email-domains/index.json at master · ivolo/disposable-email-domains · GitHub](https://github.com/ivolo/disposable-email-domains/blob/master/index.json)

Email validation services can detect and block email addresses generated by
such email privacy services. This renders many privacy services ineffective
or insufficient for use in all cases.
